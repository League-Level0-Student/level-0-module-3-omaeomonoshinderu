While seeming almost emotionless on the surface, the Capricorn’s mind is always running on overdrive. They can often seem selfish and stingy, keeping information to themselves, or strategically withholding information for their own gain. Often they can be the less imaginative of the signs and refuse to face the facts about a situation because it would signal that they were wrong about something (which they hate).\n" +

They are deeply caring about others and don’t like to see people become unhappy.\n" +
